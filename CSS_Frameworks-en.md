# CSS Frameworks

## Introduction

Much like **JavaScript** frameworks and libraries, there are **CSS** frameworks. These are mainly based on sets of **CSS** classes that have certain styles to apply more effectively to your code, as an example, a class named `btn` that improves the look and feedback of a button.

Some frameworks even provide complete components, which include **HTML**, **CSS**, and sometimes **JavaScript** codes, to implement specific functionalities. For example, a button that opens a modal window. This would be an example of a modal component.

In this section, we will focus on those frameworks which offer more general utilities and are the most popular in the industry. Nevertheless, there is a wide range of other frameworks which are specialized in more specific functionalities and are also very good. As with **JavaScript** frameworks or libraries, it's important not to abuse them in projects to avoid problems of performance and compatibility.
