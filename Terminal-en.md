# Terminal

## Introduction

The Terminal, often referred to as the console, is the user interface for command-line operations. It's a screen, typically with a black background and white text, where we input commands (special sequences of words) to instruct the system to perform specific actions. In this guide, I'll focus on teaching you the **Bash** terminal language, which is highly similar to the one used in **Linux** and also found in **macOS**.
