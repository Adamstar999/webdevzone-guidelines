# JavaScript Compilation

## Introduction

Having learned the three fundamentals of web programming (**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**), it's now time to delve into the tools and technologies that will accelerate web development. However, first, we need to grasp some basic concepts to effectively apply these technologies.

## Tutorial

### npm

**npm** (Node Package Manager) is a vital tool for managing packages in **Node.js**. It enables you to execute **JavaScript** not just in web browsers, but also on desktop systems and web servers.

This package manager streamlines the automatic installation of **JavaScript** (for both **Node.js** and web browsers) and its maintenance in projects.

To get started, install **Node.js**, the compiler that allows you to run **JavaScript** on your computer. Once installed, **npm** will be ready for use.

For an in-depth guide on what **Node.js** and **npm** are, how to install them, and managing dependencies, I recommend the following videos:

### Compilation Tools

These tools are designed to bundle modules, essentially creating a single file containing all the necessary modules for your application to function properly. They also allow for additional functionalities, speed up the development process, and facilitate conversion between different languages. For instance, you can consolidate all your **JavaScript** files into one, and even include style files there. There are various tools available, ranging from simpler and more limited to more complex and flexible ones.

Keep in mind that this information will become more useful when you connect it with the next section. However, I recommend familiarizing yourself with these tools and selecting the one that suits you best. I've provided two videos for you. The first one explains the differences between the most common tools, their advantages and disadvantages, and how to start a project with each of them: **[React Options](https://www.youtube.com)**. The second video is optional and focuses on **Webpack**. Although it may seem similar, it doesn't offer any pre-designed templates and requires configuration from scratch. You can choose to use this one, but bear in mind that it will be more complex, as you'll have to do more to launch your projects. On the flip side, **Webpack** will provide a deeper understanding of how these tools work internally. Here is the video: **[Webpack Course](https://www.youtube.com)**.

## Conclusion

Now you know how to compile code for web use. However, this is just the beginning, as the next section delves into **JavaScript** frameworks, which is an extensive topic. Be prepared!
