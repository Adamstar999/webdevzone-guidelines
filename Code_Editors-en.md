# Code Editors

## Introduction

Code editors are essential tools for every developer. They allow you to modify source code in various programming languages and provide functions to simplify work and enhance efficiency.

It's important to differentiate between code editors and **IDEs** (_Integrated Development Environments_). Editors for web development are generally lightweight programs or online platforms that offer everything you need for an effective and productive development experience, without unnecessary complexities. However, you can also use an **IDE** for web development.

Modern editors can expand their functionality through plugins, potentially making them as comprehensive as an **IDE**.

There are numerous code editors in the programming field, giving you the freedom to choose the one that suits you best. If you're unsure or lack knowledge in this area, let me introduce you to an excellent option. In this section, we'll discuss **Visual Studio Code**, known for its user-friendliness and wide range of functionalities. Other noteworthy editors include **Sublime Text** and **Vim**. However, note that **Sublime Text** is a paid option, and while **Vim** may have a steep learning curve initially, once mastered, it can significantly increase typing speed.

-   To create personalized keyboard shortcuts for **Visual Studio Code**, follow these steps:

    1. Go to preferences via the "File" menu, select "Preferences," and then "Keyboard Shortcuts." Alternatively, use the shortcut `Ctrl + K Ctrl + S`.
    2. Search for the command you want to create a shortcut for. Edit existing shortcuts or create a new one by clicking the "+" symbol at the top.
    3. Define the key combination for your personalized shortcut, using `Ctrl`, `Shift`, and `Alt` in combination with other keys. Ensure there are no conflicts with existing keyboard shortcuts.
    4. Save the modifications to the keyboard shortcuts file. Test the new shortcut to verify its expected behavior.

There are predefined snippets for almost every technology created by the community, which you can find in the extensions section. To create a snippet, press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then select `Snippets: Configure User Snippets` and start writing the snippet in the desired language. You'll find a brief explanation of how to do it there.
