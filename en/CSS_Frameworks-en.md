# CSS Frameworks

## Introduction

Much like **JavaScript** frameworks and libraries, there are **CSS** frameworks. These are mainly based on sets of **CSS** classes that have certain styles to apply more effectively to your code, as an example, a class named `btn` that improves the look and feedback of a button.

Some frameworks even provide complete components, which include **HTML**, **CSS**, and sometimes **JavaScript** codes, to implement specific functionalities. For example, a button that opens a modal window. This would be an example of a modal component.

In this section, we will focus on two frameworks that offer general utilities and are among the most popular in the industry: **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind**. However, there is a wide range of other frameworks that specialize in more specific functionalities and are also very effective. As with **JavaScript** frameworks or libraries, it's important not to overuse them in projects to avoid issues with performance and compatibility.

## Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices

-   When using **Bootstrap** via **CDN**, remember that if you only import the style sheet and not the associated **JavaScript** file, some component functionalities may not work. This is because there is a library called **Popper** in that file, which enables certain interactions of the components.

-   Since **Bootstrap** is written in **SASS**, if you're familiar with **SASS**, it will be easier to modify variables like colors or sizes. We'll cover **SASS** in the next section.

-   If your foundational knowledge of **CSS** is limited, I don't recommend using a framework. If any issues arise, such as with a particular style or a specificity problem, you might find it challenging to resolve. So, before diving into any framework, ensure you have a good understanding of its underlying principles.

-   You can view all the **Bootstrap** classes by opening the **CDN** style sheet link and removing the `.min` extension. This will give you a comprehensive view of the main **Bootstrap** style sheet.

-   Nearly every class in **Bootstrap** follows this pattern: `property-size-value`. For example: `mt-md-3` or `justify-content-lg-center`.
