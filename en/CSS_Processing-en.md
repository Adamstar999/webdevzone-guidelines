# CSS Processing

## Introduction

When working with **CSS**, certain tasks can become repetitive or complex. That's why, on many occasions, we manipulate **CSS** code directly in **JavaScript**, rather than in the style sheet.

However, some time ago, technologies emerged that introduced new functionalities and improved the creation of styles. These tools are known as **CSS** preprocessors and postprocessors.

A preprocessor allows you to write code similar to **CSS**, but with additional functionalities like functions, variables, conditions, etc. This makes it more akin to a complete programming language. Later, this code is compiled into pure **CSS**, enhancing the efficiency and speed of style programming.

Postprocessors are less complex. Generally, they take the provided **CSS** code and enhance it by adding prefixes or reducing its size (removing unnecessary blank spaces and line breaks).

These tools are not mandatory, and they are not highly demanded in the job market. The decision to use them is up to you. The situation is quite similar to **CSS** frameworks; they are not obligatory, but they can facilitate development and job searching, although preprocessors are less requested than frameworks.

Regarding preprocessors, we will focus on a particular one, **SASS**. There are others like **Less** or **Stylus**, but they are less commonly used and, consequently, less requested. However, if you prefer to use another one, you can do so without any issues, as all of them are equally valid. As for postprocessors, we will cover **PostCSS** for the same reason as the preprocessors.
