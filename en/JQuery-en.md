# JQuery

## Introduction

Before the arrival of modern **JavaScript** libraries and frameworks for constructing **SPA** websites, such as **React**, **Vue**, and others, the predominant tool of that era was **jQuery**. This library facilitated interaction with **HTML** elements, allowing for style adjustments, cross-browser compatibility checks, and error reduction in **JavaScript** functions. During its time, **jQuery** was the go-to tool.

In contemporary projects, there's generally no need for **jQuery**, as all its functionalities are now covered by native **JavaScript**. However, many projects still use **jQuery**, often due to the substantial effort and cost it would take to transition to a newer framework or library, particularly in large projects. For independent developers or freelancers, learning **jQuery** may not be imperative at this point. However, in many companies, knowledge of **jQuery** is a prerequisite for certain positions, thereby expanding job opportunities. Mastering **jQuery** is relatively straightforward if you already have a grasp of **JavaScript**'s **DOM**.
