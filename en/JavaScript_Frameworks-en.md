# JavaScript Frameworks

## Introduction

Frameworks have been in existence for decades. They are essentially sets of pre-written code designed to streamline the development of specific functions or projects.

For instance, imagine implementing a feature where users can drag elements on the screen while holding down the mouse click, and the element remains in the position where the click was released. This function is commonly known as "_drag and drop_". While achievable with pure **JavaScript**, using a library can save time by not having to start from scratch.

There are more extensive and comprehensive libraries or frameworks that facilitate the creation of much more complex projects. **jQuery**, once highly popular, offered simple solutions for compatibility issues across browsers. However, there's little benefit in using it nowadays as it doesn't introduce anything new and only adds unnecessary bulk. Contemporary frameworks and libraries enable the optimization of web application development from start to finish.

It's crucial to be mindful of excessive reliance on libraries and frameworks, as it can potentially slow down the application's performance due to the additional processing the browser has to handle. Moreover, having multiple libraries in your project can lead to compatibility issues that are challenging to resolve. In this section, our main focus will be on one particular framework, namely **React**, but we'll also touch on key aspects and resources of other frameworks.

## Tutorial

The list of frameworks and libraries is extensive and continues to expand each year. Below, I'll mention the most relevant ones in my opinion, along with their respective tutorials or courses.

I'll also provide some supplementary videos about **React**, given its central importance.

While I won't rule out the possibility of adding more content on other libraries or frameworks in the future, for now, we'll concentrate solely on **React**. However, if you prefer to explore other options, feel free to seek out online resources and use them, as they are all equally valid.

## Resources

-   This image illustrates an advisable way to organize the folders in your **React** projects:

## Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices

-   You can use the `HashRouter` component, especially if you have cases where URLs on your page encounter issues when accessed from another location. This is a common occurrence with shared hosting. Nevertheless, it's generally better to use `BrowserRouter`.

## Exercises and Projects

-   The **[JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery)** YouTube channel offers a range of videos for daily project practice using the latest technologies.
-   **[FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)** provides a course with practical exercises and offers a widely recognized certification.

## Conclusion

After becoming proficient with a framework or library and gaining ample practice, you'll not only be able to create a website with a complex and organized structure, but also possess the necessary knowledge to embark on a job search. There will be a section to guide you through the job search process and advise on what to include in your CV. We'll also cover topics more oriented towards design, such as **CSS** frameworks. However, in comparison to **JavaScript** frameworks and libraries, they are relatively straightforward.
