# JavaScript Compilation

## Introduction

Having learned the three fundamentals of web programming (**HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**), it's now time to delve into the tools and technologies that will accelerate web development. However, first, we need to grasp some basic concepts to effectively apply these technologies.

## Tutorial

### npm

**npm** (Node Package Manager) is a vital tool for managing packages in **Node.js**. It enables you to execute **JavaScript** not just in web browsers, but also on desktop systems and web servers.

This package manager streamlines the automatic installation of **JavaScript** (for both **Node.js** and web browsers) and its maintenance in projects.

To get started, install **Node.js**, the compiler that allows you to run **JavaScript** on your computer. Once installed, **npm** will be ready for use.

For an in-depth guide on what **Node.js** and **npm** are, how to install them, and managing dependencies, I recommend the following videos:

### Compilation Tools

These tools are designed to bundle modules, essentially creating a single file containing all the necessary modules for your application to function properly. They also allow for additional functionalities, speed up the development process, and facilitate conversion between different languages. For instance, you can consolidate all your **JavaScript** files into one, and even include style files there. There are various tools available, ranging from simpler and more limited to more complex and flexible ones. Here's an introductory video to these kinds of tools: **[Module Bundlers Explained... Webpack, Rollup, Parcel, and Snowpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IG4UmULyoA)**.

Keep in mind that this information will become more useful when you connect it with the next section. However, I recommend familiarizing yourself with these tools and selecting the one that suits you best.

-   **Webpack** is a module bundler that allows you to generate a single file containing all the modules required for your application to work. For example, it lets you include all the **JavaScript** in just one file, and even include style files in the same file, known as **bundle.js**. Additionally, you can perform other tasks like code optimization such as minification and compression. With **Webpack**, you can manage all your dependencies, but it doesn't have any default configuration, so you'll have to manage everything yourself. It's more complex to use, but much more customizable and flexible. If you're interested in learning it, here's a tutorial: **[Webpack 5 Full Course (Babel, PostCSS, npx, Node.js & npm)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBR65bs9CA)**.

-   Sometimes, configuring all the dependencies in **Webpack** can be tedious. That's why many tools have emerged to offer templates to start a project. Additionally, many of them provide additional functions and possibilities. Here are some videos about these tools and how to start a project with them:

## Conclusion

Now you know how to compile code for web use. However, this is just the beginning, as the next section delves into **JavaScript** frameworks, which is an extensive topic. Be prepared!
