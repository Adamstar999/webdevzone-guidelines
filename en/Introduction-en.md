# Introduction

If you're interested in learning about programming, specifically web development, you're in the right place. Here, you'll find all the information you need to start your journey in web development. I'll provide you with important details and helpful resources to guide you towards becoming a web developer. Whether you want to work on your own or for a company, this page has you covered. Just remember, this page doesn't offer a complete course. It's here to gather and organize existing courses so you don't have to search and feel overwhelmed.

Before we dive into programming, let's cover some important basics. Start by understanding these topics:

-   Personal Motivation
-   Development Scope
-   Code Editor
-   Technologies and Languages
-   Additional Considerations

## Personal Motivation

Before embarking on your programming journey, reflect on why you're interested in web development. Your reasons may vary, but it's essential to establish your objectives before you start writing code. Many people opt for web development initially due to its user-friendly and approachable nature. I completely understand, as I began the same way. However, it's crucial not to underestimate the learning process. Keep in mind that virtually all programming areas come with similar levels of difficulty and complexity.

Don't expect it to be a walk in the park, especially considering the recent surge in competition in this field. This increase in demand for web programmers is a direct result of the impact of the **COVID-19** pandemic.

As the demand for web developers has risen, so has the number of **Bootcamps**. **Bootcamps** are fast-paced courses focused on a specific professional area. This adds an extra layer of challenge to web development. Moreover, you'll also need to navigate through a wide range of technologies to master.

It's crucial to note that some people are drawn to learning programming mainly for the potential high income. However, if you lack a genuine interest in the field, I strongly advise you to reconsider starting. It can be overwhelming, and you might quickly feel like giving up on learning. On the other hand, if your aim is to share your own content on the internet, collaborate on others' digital projects, and contribute to the online world, then learning web programming could be a very fulfilling option for you.

## Development Scope

It's crucial to define the path you want to take in web development, as it's broadly split into two main areas. The Front-end focuses on the visual appearance and functionality of a page, while the Back-end manages the operation, storage, organization, and deployment of information. Additionally, there are disciplines like web design and DevOps.

DevOps aims to enhance the use of development tools for both Front-end and Back-end. Web design centers on visual aesthetics and user experience. Currently, this platform will exclusively specialize in Front-end and web design. However, I might incorporate the Back-end aspect in the future.

You have the choice to specialize as a Front-end developer, Back-end developer, DevOps developer, or a Full-Stack developer (which involves proficiency in both Front-end and Back-end, and some knowledge of DevOps).

## Code Editor

Before you dive into web development, you need a platform to write code. While you can use a basic text editor like Notepad, it's quite limited in terms of development tools. This is where code editors come in. They offer a wide range of benefits compared to standard text editors.

Code editors provide features like auto-completion, error detection, efficient shortcuts, full customization, and many other handy utilities. There are numerous options available, both online through websites and as desktop programs. For this occasion, I recommend **Visual Studio Code** because it comes with a wealth of extensions and functionalities. It's also open source, allowing you to create new features and tailor the editor to your needs. That's why it's one of the most popular choices in the community.

However, remember, this is just a personal suggestion. If you prefer another code editor, go for it! The choice is entirely yours. Just remember, steer clear of basic text editors. Code editors make the development process much smoother and help prevent mistakes.

## Technologies and Languages
